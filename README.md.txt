Sales Prediction Project

Overview

This project aims to predict sales based on advertising expenditure across different media channels, including TV, radio and newspapers. By using linear regression, you can analyze how these advertising channels impact sales.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is advertising.csv, which contains the following columns:

TV: Amount spent on TV advertising
Radio: Amount spent on radio advertising
Newspaper: Amount spent on newspaper advertising
Sales: Actual sales generated

Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib: For data visualization
Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating the predictive model

Steps Involved:

1. Load Data: Read the dataset into a data frame
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data structure and visualize relationships
3. Data Cleaning: Check for missing values and fill them as needed
4. Split Data: Divide the dataset into features and target variables, and then into training and testing sets
5. Model Building: Use linear regression to build the predictive model
6. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared
Results

The model provides predictions of sales based on advertising spend, which can be used to make informed decisions about future advertising budgets
